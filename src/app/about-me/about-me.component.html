            <p>I transform concepts into intuitive interfaces. My credo is to fuse beauty and functionality for memorable user experiences. But that's not all! 🎨 I'm also very interested in UX/UI design, which I'm learning in my spare time.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="component-body">
            <p>The backend is my favorite part of fullstack development. I have an unbridled passion for everything that goes on behind the scenes of an application. My playground? RESTful APIs, scalability and application security.
              But there's more! 🌟 I'm a fan of good development practices, microservices architectures, and deployment automation.</p>

            <p>Outside the code, you'll probably find me devouring a mystery novel, playing Scrabble or traveling. I also enjoy spending time with family and friends.</p>
